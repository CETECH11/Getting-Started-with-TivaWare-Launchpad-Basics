Texas Instruments, also known as TI, is an embedded design company, that designs, manufactures and sells embedded systems. These systems include semiconductors, integrated circuits, development boards, etc, for industrial, commercial, automotive, and personal electronics. Tivaware is an initiative by TI to manufacture a series of MCUs that support a common SDK.

The TivaWare for software development kit (SDK) provides all of the components necessary for engineers to evaluate and develop applications for the Texas Instruments TM4C Arm Cortex - M4F device family. Based on Embedded C language, it allows developers to get started quickly, uses already-tested development methods and drivers that take less time to build and create.

In our case, we'll be using a basic microcontroller board TM4C123GXL, which has the same properties as an STM Nucleo Board. TI Boards for this series are termed as 'Launchpad' due to its ability to support other booster drivers and boards that'll give extra support to provide more features.

This Tivaware Launchpad (TM4C123GXL) has the following features :

Tiva TM4C123GH6PMI microcontroller
Motion control PWM
USB micro-A and micro-B connectors for USB device, host, and on-the-go (OTG) connectivity
RGB user LED
Two user switches (application/wake)
Available I/O brought out to headers on a 0.1-in (2.54-mm) grid
On-board ICDI
Switch-selectable power sources: – ICDI – USB device
Reset switch
Preloaded RGB quickstart application

Ports are the peripheral pins on an embedded system, or SoC to communicate with the external environment. Whenever a port receives a HIGH or LOW signal, it communicates throughout the system.A PORT is usually bit-packed, i.e. each port is represented with an 8-bit binary number. The number count starts from right to left. So when we mention a pin's address as 0x0E - it means we are pointing at the pins which are O
